# BRO-Tracker 2.0

Before Windows 95 came I used to code in Turbo Pascal. The BRO-Tracker project was started in order to allow me to experiment with tracking in general and also to allow me to add music to my games.
I chose adlib because that was a> easier to code back then, and I had very detailed documentation on how to code adlib routines for any programming language and b> friendler on my RAM which was quite an issue back then.

The release and (undeserved) success of Windows 95 killed this project off before it was even finished and although in a few games of mine now appearing on modern systems tunes written in BRO-Tracker were used (converted into digital formats such as WAV and OGG) it was never seriously taken into use.

Still what I had was too good to go to waste especially when I remember the effort I took to code all this back then. Please note the code looks dirty, crappy and is completely not the style in which I code today. I was young, inexperienced and not caring much back then. Really when I look at this code I feel embarrassed to see how amateur this looks.
BRO-Tracker was planned as a ShareWare project (very common back in the day as a more free way to distribute software back then) in which some extra features would be given for people who actually paid for BRO-Tracker, and some portions of the source show this, however I really do not wanna work those out anymore, as well, my schedule is basically set to other things, but if you insist I should finish those, just write me a ticket... Perhaps I can be swayed (if I got the time)


This code was tested in Turbo Pascal 7.0 (with the help of DOSBox) prior to release here on GitHub.

I hereby offer BRO-Tracker up to the open source community under the terms of the GPL3 (some units under zlib).

I do have quite a number of songs written in BRO-Tracker or which were imported from HSC tracker (which BRO-Tracker supports read-only), however as some of them are "covers" or "remixes" and the HSC modules not being mine at all, I cannot publish them, this to avoid copyright issues. 


In order to compile, simply make sure Turbo Pascal has been installed in C:\TP and run the BLD.BAT file in DOSBox to get your binaries.


Cheers
